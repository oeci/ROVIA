ROVIA: AUTOMATED DEEP-SEA VIDEO HIGHLIGHT GENERATOR USING DEEP NEURAL NETWORKS

We developed ROVIA using deep neural networks that can generate deep-sea video highlights automatically and quickly. It’s a field deployable and portable tool that can be used in ocean exploration. 

To run ROVIA on your local computer (Windows/Mac OS machine), please follow the instructions mentioned in the UserGuide.pdf. The 'rovia.py' code must be used in conjunction with the model file that’s available to be downloaded from:

We thank NOAA Ocean Exploration, Ocean Exploration Trust, and Schmidt Ocean Institute for making the ROV dive video publicly available. This project was generously supported by the NOAA Ocean Exploration Cooperative Institute (OECI).
